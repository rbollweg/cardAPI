# cardAPI
Simple API for a database to hold users "card" info based on node.js, more of a proof of concept than anything.

Database is simple mySQL, would probably want to use mongoBD for anything that requires a large amount of requests.

Currently, this is just a simple API run by node.js with some basic HTML to display that database.


To Do: 

-Encoding database requests

-Securing API with json token

-C# "Front end"
